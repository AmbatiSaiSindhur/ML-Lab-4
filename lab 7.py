# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

# Step 2: Create an SVM classifier object
clf = svm.SVC()

# Step 3: Train the SVM classifier on your training data (replace X_train and y_train)
X_train = ...  # Your training data (2D array-like)
y_train = ...  # Corresponding class labels (1D array or list)

clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Retrieve the support vectors
